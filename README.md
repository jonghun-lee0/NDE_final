# On Neural Differential Equations

This repository contains the implementation of the paper **"On Neural Differential Equations"**. The code has been written to recreate the pipeline and experiments from the original paper. This is not the official implementation, but rather a re-implementation based on the paper.

## Paper Reference

- **Title**: On Neural Differential Equations
- **Authors**: 
  - Patrick Kidger
- **Paper Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02435)

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and follow the instructions below to set up the necessary environment and run the code.

### Prerequisites
